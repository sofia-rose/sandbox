# TODO

* Do something about the manual hacking of the deployment to add the option `--allow-unsafe-aws-endpoint-urls true`
  * Setup TLS for localstack?
* Is it possible to use iam roles instead of iam users and keys with localstack and kind?
* Add kubectl to awscli-shell image
* Move awscli-shell to run in ack-system namespace?
* Add rbac to awscli-shell deployment so kubectl can do things
